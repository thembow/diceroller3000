# diceroller3000
java app that simulates rolling dice of various sizes

# about
Choose a dice size (dX = dice of size X) and roll the dice to see what number you get.

# dev notes
Originally this program was a way for me to make something with a GUI, but I ended up learning a lot of other things in the process.
1. building a jar without an IDE holding your hand is more difficult but worth doing.
2. not every system with Java has JavaFX, so its worth finding a JDK that lets you build a program that includes the library with it.
3. files included with a compiled .jar file become weird and compressed so you have to access them differently than you would with normal files on the system.
4. regularly taking breaks while troubleshooting will keep you sane.
